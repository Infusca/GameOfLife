# GameOfLife

My Game of Life game I made using Python. Credit goes to TechWithTim - link below. I followed along with his tutorial.

Rules:

c - to clear
g - to initiate random pattern
space - to pause/unpause
mouse - to click and add/remove active squares
For anyone interested, I'll explain the game below as well:
1. Any active square with 1 or fewer neighbors will die
2. Any active square with 2-3 neighbors will live/survive
3. Any active square with 4+ neighbors will die
4. Any empty square with exactly 3 neighbors will become alive
